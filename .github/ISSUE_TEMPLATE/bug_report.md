**Describe the bug**
To get most details please let ETWAnalyzer run with the -debug switch to get extended console output.
In many cases the log file is of great help to identify the issue. 

**To Reproduce**
If the error is not dependent on the input ETL file you can share the used command line 
to force the error.
If during extraction with specific ETL files goes wrong we would need that file to reproduce the issue and talk potentially to the maintainers of TraceProcessing if that is the expected behavior.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
